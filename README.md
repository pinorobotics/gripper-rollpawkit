**gripper-rollpawkit** - integration of Standard Gripper Kit Paw for Robotic Arm Rollarm DIY Robot with ROS (Robotic Operation System)

This is a ROS package which provides an URDF model of the gripper.

This is not 1:1 mapping which means some elements of the parts are not present. It is done to reduce model complexity for faster simulations.
